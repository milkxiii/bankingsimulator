## Overview
The banking application will be used by tellers in the branch to manage daily customer banking needs, such as:

- Make withdrawal
- View most recent transaction
- Calculate interest
- Customer management
  - Create accounts for new customer
  - Create customer profile
  - See user information (e.g. name, DOB, account creation date)


## How was it made?
### 1.1 Create a terminal version with key features
- Input/output done through console
- Customer and Account classes

### 1.2 Add Swing GUI
- Input/output through dialog, button, label, text box, radio button in Swing instead of console
-	Associate event handler to specific UI components with its respective methods (e.g. button, radio button)

### 1.3	Persist into database
- Start Derby DB and make accessible from within Eclipse through JDBC
- Create table Customer and Account, update tables with JDBC based code in PersistanceManager
